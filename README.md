# Anomaly Detection for ATLAS Triggers: post-training HLT studies

This repository contains plotting macros to analyze and explore the Enhanced Bias (EB) + signal datasets after the AE training, i.e. with assigned Anomaly scores.

The tools provided here focus on examining event kinematic variables and their correlation with low/high anomaly scores.
