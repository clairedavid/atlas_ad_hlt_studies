# Anomaly Detection for ATLAS Triggers: post-training HLT studies

This repository contains plotting macros to analyze and explore the Enhanced Bias (EB) + other datasets after the AE training, i.e. with assigned Anomaly scores.

The tools provided here focus on examining event kinematic variables and their correlation with low/high anomaly scores.

In (total) development.

## Update February 2025
The file ```plot_utils.py``` has been archived as ```plot_utils_2024.py``` (as coded for the previous dataset) and in the future each plot type should have its utils file. Easier to avoid merge conflicts.
